Ideal for small to medium-size indoor spaces and enclosed patios, Gardner’s Flyweb Classic Fly Light attracts mosquitoes and other pests with UV light. Simply plug the unit into an electrical outlet, and watch as the light attracts pests to a glue-board adhesive that easily slides out for simple disposal and replacement.

The compact size of Gardner’s UV trap and inconspicuous design make it easy to hide in any room where you have a pest problem.
